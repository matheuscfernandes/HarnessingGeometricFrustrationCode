**Notes:**
Run the function as is and use ABAQUS input files for geometry
definitions. Please refer to the .inp for the format requested. This code
will only work with 1D geometries with specified Block-type boundary
conditions. For the numerical deptiction of this code, please refer to the
supplemental section of the article.
